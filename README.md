## Revamping Data Carpentry Python Ecology Lesson
We are using this Incubator repository as a place to redesign the Data Carpentry _Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists_ lesson.
The goal is to update and realign the lesson content with [the R lesson](https://datacarpentry.github.io/R-ecology-lesson/), which was [revamped in 2024](https://carpentries.org/blog/2024/03/dc-r-ecology-adoption/).

## Contributing
If you would like to get involved in this lesson update effort, please get in touch! 
You can open an issue on the repository, post a message in the `dc-ecology-py` channel in The Carpentries Slack workspace, or [contact the Curriculum Team by email](mailto:curriculum@carpentries.org).
